# Zebra Emulator

This Mac OS X application allows you to quickly emulate a ZPL printer on port 9100.
It will also emulate a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) printer by broadcasting as your computer's name.
Labels are rendered via the wonderful [Labelary](http://labelary.com/viewer.html) folks and displayed in the application window.
