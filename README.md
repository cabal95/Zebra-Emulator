# Zemulator

Zemulator is an application that allows you to emulate a ZPL compatible printer.
While running, the application will listen for print requests on port 9100.
If your computer supports Bluetooth Low Energy in Peripheral mode, it will also act like a bluetooth ZPL printer.

Labels are rendered via the wonderful [Labelary](http://labelary.com/viewer.html) folks and displayed in the application window.

You can adjust the emulated details of the printer, such as label size, in the settings panel.
